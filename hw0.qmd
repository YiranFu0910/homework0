## Code

The solution(s) of the equation:

```{r}
solve_equation <- function(a, b, c)
  {
  #check if there's real solution
  if(b^2 - 4*a*c < 0){
    #if no real solutions, return null
    return (NULL) }
  solution <- c((-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a), (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)) / (2*a))
  #check if two solutions are the same
  if (solution[1] == solution[2]){
    return(solution[1]) } 
  return(solution)
}
a<-1
b<-3
c<-2
solve_equation(a,b,c)
```

## Plot

```{r}

x<-seq(-5, 5, 0.1)
plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
```

The result shown in the plot matches the solution above. 
When a=1, b=3, c=2, from the plot we could see there are two intersections at x=-1 and -2, which means the equation has two real solutions
